## Evolution of recombination landscapes
We work on methods for inference of recombination patterns in ancestral populations. A recombination map for the ancestor of two closely related species can be derived using coalescent hidden Markov models. This type of analysis helps us understand how recombination patterns evolve and how recombination drives non-adaptive evolution of genomes. We am currently extending this work to ancestral species across the primate species tree tree.

## Interaction between selection and recombination
We analyse large primate data sets to understand how recombination effects selection (Hill-Robertson interference) in closely related species with different demographic histories. We also work on how recombination rate evolves in response to positive selection across the primate species tree.

## Impact of selective sweeps across evolutionary time scales
We develop methods to identify selective sweeps from large sets of full genomes. We also develop methods for inference of selection ancestral species. These methods use incomplete lineage sorting to identify selective sweeps across evolutionary time scales. We currently employ these methods to quantify the dramatically varying intensity of positive selection across the species ancestral to humans.

## The X chromosome and speciation
I am involved in several projects that address the unique forces acting on X chromosomes. We recently identified very megabase-wide depletions in diversity of great apes. We pursue the hypothesis that this selection is due to meiotic drive on ampliconic genes in these regions, and that their rapid evolution of these genes contribute to hybrid incompatibility between emerging species.
